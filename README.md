## Trend Micro Deep Security on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start automatically deploys Trend Micro Deep Security on AWS, using AWS services and best practices.

Trend Micro Deep Security is a host-based security product that provides Intrusion Detection and Prevention, Anti-Malware, 
Host Firewall, File and System Integrity Monitoring, Log Inspection, and Content Filtering modules in a single agent running 
in the guest operating system.

This Quick Start deploys Deep Security using AWS CloudFormation templates and offers two license models: 
Per Protected Instance Hour and Bring Your Own License (BYOL). 
You can also launch the Quick Start with either licensing option in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.

The default configuration protects instances in the VPC where the Deep Security Manager is deployed. 
After deployment, you can modify your setup to protect instances across your entire AWS infrastructure.
