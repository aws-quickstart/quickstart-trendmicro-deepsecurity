As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway that connects the VPC to the internet.
* In the public subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for Deep Security Manager.
** Elastic Load Balancing that distributes incoming traffic across the Amazon EC2 instances (not shown).
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to set up, operate, and scale a relational database.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
